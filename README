			Turbotap

Conventional Tun driver in linux kernel provides file operations to send and
receive messages through tun/tap interfaces. But Turbotap provide socket based
interfaces on top of Tun driver. User application can simply send and receive
messages using socket based system calls sendmsg/recvmsg.

It also allows user applications to send and receive multiple messages using few
system calls by using sendmmsg/recvmmsg.
